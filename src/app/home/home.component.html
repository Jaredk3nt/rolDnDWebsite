            Based in Humanities far future: a collection of alien species have formed a coalition called the Republic of Life, in a densely populated portion of the Milky Way known as The Sphere. You can take up the adventurers mantle as an Adept (a person with supernatural abilities) or an Enhanced (someone who has upgrade themselves cybernetically) from one of the many races living in this futuristic metropolis of stars.
